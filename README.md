# Open Code Scene (OCS)

is inspired by and the books from **Adam Tornhill**.

1. Your Code as a Crime Scene
2. Software Design X-Rays

It is a reimplementation of Adam's
[Code Maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat)
but in pure Rust.

Why?

- There is hope, that the Rust implementation will be must faster for larger
  code bases. There are libraries addressing git and cloc. Thus, everything
  can be performed within one process with very fast algorithms.
- The strong type system and the guarantees for memory safety and thread safety
  allow for robust code.
- Build in testing capabilities allows test driven implementations from the beginning.

It starts as a playground.
Contribution policies, a roadmap, etc will be next.
